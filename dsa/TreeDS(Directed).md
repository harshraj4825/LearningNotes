## Terminology
|Term|Definition|
|----|----------|
|Node| A single element in a tree|
|Root| The topmost node(starting point of tree)|
|Parent| A node that has child nodes|
|Child| A node that is a descendant of another node|
|Sibling| Nodes that share the same parent|
|Leaf| A node without children|
|Edge| A connection between two nodes|
|Height| The longest path from root to a leaf|
|Depth| Distance)no of node) of a node from the root|
|Level| Distance of a node from the root|
|Path| Sequence of cosucative edges between source to destination|
|Anccestor|Any predesessor node on the path from root to that node|
|Descendant|Any successor node on the path from that node to leaf node|
|Subtree| Containing node with all its descendeant|
|Degree of node| No. of children of that node|
|Degree of tree| Max. Degree of any node in that tree|
  
no. of nodes= (n-1) edge
